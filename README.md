# Differentiable GPU-friendly Direct Linear Transform
This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of the GPU-friendly formulation of Direct Linear Transform proposed in the paper ["Lightweight Multi-View 3D Pose Estimation through Camera-Disentangled Representation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02186) (CVPR 2020).

The Direct Linear Transform (DLT) algorithm can be used to solve a set of similarity equations of the form
